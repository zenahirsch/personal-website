Years ago, I started a Tumblr with a list of “good cat names.” These are names that I’ve thought of or encountered that just seem like they would suit a cat. I’ve tried to recreate that collection of names here, and will continue to add to it as fancy strikes.

To be clear, I don’t own a cat nor do I intend to get one. I’m just a girl who likes to collect cat names. If you use any of these, I’d love to hear about it!
