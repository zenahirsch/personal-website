I'm pregnant. There's a pandemic going on. And it's totally fine.

Don't get me wrong, this pandemic sucks, and sucks _very badly_ for many people. It needs to end soon, or we're all going to lose our damn minds (and for many, their livelihoods and/or lives). But as far as my pregnancy goes, things have been... fine. Good, even. Turns out, sitting around watching Netflix and eating frozen taquitos is more or less what I'd want to be doing right now, anyway.

Doctor appointments have been a bit strange: there's the required masks and constant temperature screenings and the fact that Aaron can't join me most of the time. We've learned that video chatting doesn't work all that great from inside an ultrasound room. I use my elbow to push the elevator buttons and pump the Purell every time I pass one in the hallway. But other than that, it's been pretty normal.

For me, being pregnant is more or less easy for the time being. I'm certainly glad I'm not stuck in either the previous step (fertility treatments) or the next step (early motherhood) right now. Hopefully the situation will improve before my due date, but I'm not holding my breath. There's a chance that my baby's grandparents won't get to safely meet him for several months, and that introductions will need to happen over Zoom and Instagram. But if that's the worst that happens, I'll take it.

For now, I'm continuing to take each day as it comes, and feeling grateful that, overall, I'm doing okay.
