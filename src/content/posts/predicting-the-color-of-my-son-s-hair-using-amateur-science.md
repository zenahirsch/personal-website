title: Predicting the color of my son's hair using amateur science
summary: I don't know anything about genetics, so here's an in-depth analysis of my
  baby's potential genotype.

---
Lately, I've been wondering if my unborn son will have red hair. (Because there's only so much Netflix I can watch in a day.) I became particularly interested in this question while reading _Red: A History of the Redhead_ by Jacky Colliss Harvey. I decided to do some digging into my genome (and my husband's) to see what I could find out. For the record, my husband has dark blond hair, while mine is red.

## Thoughts on red hair

I view red hair as something of a mixed blessing. Without a doubt, redheads are highly stereotyped and often treated with prejudice, both positively and negatively. Red hair is often objectively beautiful, but also comes with the stigma of standing out, of feeling like an _other_. Harvey's book goes into this subject in detail, and I highly recommend it for any redheads out there looking to make sense of a lifetime of complicated feelings.

While I certainly want my child to be unique and beautiful, I also want to protect him from some of these prejudices. No matter the outcome, there will be a bright side and a dark side. 

I also want to mention that I hate the term "ginger," especially when used as a noun. But that will be a post for another time. Yes, I'll talk about that South Park episode.

## Some science

I suppose I should say up front that I have next to no real understanding of genetics. I'm mainly going off of what I remember from high school biology, and a few dumbed down explanations from 23andMe and [snpedia.com](https://www.snpedia.com/index.php/Redheads).

The first thing I learned is that red hair is most often controlled by the [MC1R gene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanocortin_1_receptor), which lives on chromosome 16 (there are, of course, exceptions to this). On this gene, there are three markers, also known as SNPs, that are associated with red hairâ€”that 23andMe assesses. In actuality, there are other variations out there that could cause red hair, but 23andMe doesn't look at those, so I have to go with the data I have. The markers I know about are given the delightfully engaging names of [rs1805007](https://www.snpedia.com/index.php/Rs1805007), [rs1805008](https://www.snpedia.com/index.php/Rs1805008), and [i3002507](https://www.snpedia.com/index.php/Rs1805009).

Each marker has a few possible configurations of nucleic bases (guanine, thymine, adenine, uracil). Some of these configurations are very common, others are more rare. For example, for most folks, rs1805007 is composed of C/C. Variants associated with red hair include C/T and T/T.

Here's where my husband and I fall for these markers:

### Me
| Gene | Marker | Variant |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MC1R | rs1805007 | C/T |
| MC1R | rs1805008 | C/T |
| MC1R | i3002507 | G/G |


### Husband
| Gene | Marker | Variant |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MC1R | rs1805007 | C/C |
| MC1R | rs1805008 | C/C |
| MC1R | i3002507 | G/G |

The variants in bold are associated with red hair. As you can see, I have two of them, while my husband has none.

The next step was to make some old-fashioned Punnett squares for each marker, to see the possible combinations our child could inherit.

## Overall likelihood

In order to manifest red hair, a person must have two of these variants. So the outcomes look like this:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CC | CC | GG | 25% |
| CC | CT | GG | 25% |
| CT | CC | GG | 25% |
| CT | CT | GG | 25% |

Only the very last combination could result in red hair, which means there is a 25% chance of that happening. Of. course, all of this is very theoretical. I sought the insight of a stranger on the Internet with some knowledge in this area, who said a lot of complicated things that I didn't understand; the gist of it was that if I inherited the Ts in my first two markers from each parent (one from my father and one from my mother), it's likely that the chromosome I pass on will only have one T (CTG or TCG). This means the fourth combination in the table above would be impossible, and therefore my chances of having a baby with red hair would be 0%. That being said, there are other mutations that control hair color, and this analysis only scratches the surface. Anything is still possible.

Now to find something else to occupy me during this quarantine.
