What a difference a year makes.

A year ago today, Aaron and I transferred our third embryo conceived via IVF. Our hopes weren’t high; our previous two attempts had failed, following years of trying to conceive naturally and with other assisted reproductive technologies. A previous attempt had resulted in an ectopic pregnancy that left me with only one Fallopian tube, resulted in a months-long delay in treatment, and left us emotionally depleted (by the way, this was shortly before Republicans in Ohio would introduce a bill requiring doctors to “reimplant” an ectopic pregnancy in a woman’s uterus, which is impossible). Blood tests showed that I was experiencing a prematurely declining ovarian reserve. The odds didn’t seem in our favor. I felt hopeless and defective.

The process up to that point had been an intense emotional rollercoaster of hope, anxiety, endless waiting, and deep disappointment. Our schedules were tied to a rigid treatment plan of ultrasounds and injections, forcing us to miss work and cancel social events and vacations. I had bruises all over my belly and butt from the needles. We wrote checks in goggling amounts, spent hours and days on hold with our insurance company, and bought pack after pack of pregnancy tests. They always came back negative. I took pictures of the tests and inverted the colors, looking for the faintest impression of a line. My camera roll was full of these pictures.

I don’t believe in miracles, karma, or prayers (though I was touched by those who offered them), but when I finally saw the line appear on November 25, 2019, I felt an overwhelming sense of gratitude (as well as a million other emotions). If it weren’t for humanity's scientific advancements, that day probably would never have come for me and Aaron. I remember putting the test down and picking up my little dog and whispering in his ear, “It worked! It WORKED!”

A year later, our beautiful boy Milo is with us, and I am still deeply grateful every time I see his (objectively perfect) little face. Since his birth, I’ve never doubted that our journey was worth it. But I’ve also struggled with a sense of guilt, because not everyone’s IVF story has a happy ending. Worse, many IVF stories don’t even have a beginning. Reproductive technology is prohibitively expensive. It is rare for insurance to cover IVF, especially here in Michigan. Our nurses were usually surprised to hear we had any kind of IVF coverage at all. 

Even those lucky few whose plans cover it are usually only covered for a few cycles per lifetime. Successful IVF often takes many cycles to work. This is one of the reasons why so many women undergoing IVF choose to transfer two or more embryos per cycle, even though doing so significantly increases the risks associated with pregnancy and delivery: if she wants more than one child, this may be the only affordable way to achieve that.

Thankfully, we did have coverage for IVF, though we had to jump through many hoops to access it (and even now, we still haven’t received our full benefits, thanks to that company’s bureaucratic nonsense). Still, we were lucky and obviously privileged. Today, we want to pay it forward by contributing to our clinic’s Family Building Fund, which provides financial assistance to families who cannot afford IVF. I see this as a temporary measure until the day when our healthcare system can make these treatments readily available to those who need them. Until then, we want to do what we can for families who are less fortunate, but equally deserving of the joy of parenthood.

**Thank you to everyone who supported us before, during, and after our fertility journey.**
