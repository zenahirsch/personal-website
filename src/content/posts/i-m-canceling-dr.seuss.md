A few months ago, I threw out our copies of “And To Think I Saw It On Mulberry Street” and “If I Ran The Zoo” by Dr. Seuss. These weren’t books I had read in a long time (if ever?) and when I opened them and saw the blatant racist imagery I was disgusted. I couldn’t bring myself to donate the books or put them in storage—the trash felt like the only place for them. But many other Dr. Seuss books sat on our shelves, and I read them to my six month old almost daily.

I am ashamed to admit that most of the racism in Seuss’ books escaped my notice, or was explained away by thinking, “He was a product of his times.” After all, everyone loved Dr. Seuss. His birthday is practically a national holiday. It wasn’t until the recent news about several of his more egregiously racist books ending publication that I re-evaluated. When I read this article (published in xxxx), I finally came to recognize the extent of the bigotry across all of his work.

This is the problem: my exposure to these books at an early age blinded me to (or normalized) much of the racist imagery within. Some of the imagery was so embedded in my psyche that it took a scholarly article to expose it to myself  

Sure, some Dr. Seuss books may be “safe,” but knowing the kind of man the author was, I don’t find any of his titles very appealing. I won’t be reading them to my son. Some may call it “cancel culture,” but I have no problem “cancelling” this material. He may have been “a product of his times,” but there’s no rule saying I have to expose my son to that material at such an early, impressionable age. Let it be studied from a historical perspective. Right now he is learning to be a good human. 

I am replacing our Dr. Seuss collection with new books
